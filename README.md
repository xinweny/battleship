# Battleship
Battleship project developed as part of my self-guided education through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JS curriculum.

Check out the live demo [here](https://xinweny.github.io/battleship) 👈🏻

# Features
- Interactive browser-based game based on the Hasbro Battleship board game
- Allows the player to click and rotate ship placements, or place ships randomly
- AI with 'smart' algorithm that decides on moves similar to a human player
- Keeps track of current shots and shots remaining for each ship

# Main learning outcomes and challenges
- Implementing test-driven development using Jest through the game-logic development process
- Modularizing code through object-oriented paradigms
- Developing an algorithm for the AI that can decide moves smartly
